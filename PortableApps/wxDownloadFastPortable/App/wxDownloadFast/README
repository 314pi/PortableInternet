wxDownload Fast
=====================================================================

1) Introduction
---------------
This program was created with the intention of replacing existing
commercial download managers. It will have many options and be as complete
as possible.

2) Features of wxDownload Fast
---------------------------------
* Faster downloads (with Segmented/Multi-threaded/Accelerated transfers)
* Download resuming (Pause and restart where you stopped)
* Download scheduling
* Organizes files you have already downloaded
* View server messages (HTTP, FTP, file://). No HTTPS support.
* Available in multiple languages and easily translated.  Now available in
  Portuguese [Brazil], Spanish, English, German, Russian, Hungarian, Polish,
  French, Indonesian, Turkish and Dutch
* Connection to FTP/HTTP servers which require a password
* Calculates the MD5/SHA1 checksum of downloaded files so they can be easily verified
* Firefox integration through FlashGot
* Can be used as a portable download manager (Windows only)
* Can be used over proxy servers(HTTP proxy support)

3) Command line Parameters
--------------------------
[URLS],
URLs of the files to be downloaded are separated by spaces
Ex: www.foo.com/foo.exe ftp://ftp.foo.com/foo2.exe http://foo.com:8080/foo3.exe

--hide,
Start with the the main window hidden

--notray,
Don't show the icon in the system tray

-list TEXTFILE, --list=TEXTFILE,
Parse a text file with the list of files to download

-destination DIR, --destination=DIR,
Destination directory

-reference URL, --reference=URL
Parse a URL that will be set as a reference URL

-comments COMMENTS, --comments=COMMENTS,
Add comments for the download

4) Firefox Integration
----------------------
To integrate with Firefox, do the following:

1) Install the FlashGot extension for Firefox (www.flashgot.org/getit)
2) After restart the Firefox, go to Tools -> FlashGot -> More Options
3) Now select the "wxDownload Fast" on the Download Manager's List


5) Installation
---------------

5.1) Windows 2000 & XP
----------------------

- Installing from binary

Is available in the page of the program contends this program.  This archive is in
the form of an installation program.
To install the program follow the wizard.

Then to change the Language from Portuguese to English do this:
1) Start the program
2) Go to menu "Ver->Idiomas->"Ingles"

- Compiling source code

To build the program on Windows, MinGW and MSys [ www.mingw.org ] are required, 
which are the GCC compiler for Windows and Unix environments respectively.  
Other requirements include the library wxWidgets [www.wxwidgets.org ],
built with the options: --enable-xrc --enable-unicode.
Once you have the above requirements you can change to the directory where the source 
code was unpacked and type:
# make -f Makefile.gcc BUILD=win32

With this, the executable will be generated. After that, you can copy the executable to
another place and run it from there.

- Compiling source code (Portable mode)

Follow the same instructions of the last section, but add the parameter PORTABLE=1 to
the make command:
# make -f Makefile.gcc BUILD=win32 PORTABLE=1


5.2) Linux
----------

- Compiling source code

GCC and the program make are required to build the program in the Linux.
Other requirements include the library wxWidgets [ www.wxwidgets.org ], built with
the options: --enable-xrc --enable-unicode.  Once you have the above requirements you can change to
the directory where the source code was unpacked and type:
# ./configure
# make

With this, the executable will be generated. After that, you can copy the executable to
another place and run it from there. To do this, type:
# su
# make install

- Cross-compiling source code for windows

This method has as objective to create a Windows executable without the Windows.
In this case it's necessary to install MinGW on linux and build the wxWidgets
library with the follow command:
# ./configure --prefix=/usr/i586-mingw32msvc --host=i586-mingw32msvc --target=i586-mingw32msvc --with-msw --enable-monolithic --disable-shared --enable-xrc --enable-unicode
# make

Where "/usr/i586-mingw32msvc" is the directory that the MinGW was installed.

Then to build the wxDownload Fast do:
# ./configure --prefix=/usr/i586-mingw32msvc --host=i586-mingw32msvc  --with-wxdir=/home/user/wxWidgets-2.8.0
# make

Where "/home/user/wxWidgets-2.8.0" is the directoy where you built the wxWidgets.

OBS: To build in the portable mode use the parameter: --enable-portable
# ./configure --prefix=/usr/i586-mingw32msvc --host=i586-mingw32msvc  --with-wxdir=/home/user/wxWidgets-2.8.0 --enable-portable
# make


5.3) Mac OS X
----------

- Compiling source code

This has not been tested but should work using the same steps as Linux. Please report
your experiences.
