We recommend you use the default <span class="application">Ekiga</span> provider. You can get an account using the links in the configuration assistant as described above.</p><p>With the default setup, you can simply use sip:3210444555 and select sip.diamondcard.us in the list to call the real phone number +3210444555, 32 being the country code and 10444555 being the number you wish to call.</p><p>You can also dial real phone numbers from the address book.

<span class="application">Ekiga</span> allows you to add the contacts you
dial the most to the roster, so that you can call or start a chat conversation with your friends without having to remember their URI. If supported by the service you are connecting to, <span class="application">Ekiga</span> will display <span class="emphasis"><em>extended presence information</em></span> about your friends.
Ekiga.net supports publishing presence information for its users. Software PBX systems like <a class="ulink" href="http://www.asterisk.org" target="_top">Asterisk</a> can report if a user is on the phone or not, and <span class="application">Ekiga</span> will display that information in its roster.
</p><p>
You can thus use <span class="application">Ekiga</span> to monitor lines on your PBX.
</p><p>
<span class="application">Ekiga</span> is also able to detect other <span class="application">Ekiga</span> users on the LAN using the Bonjour technology popularized by Apple (tm) and to display them in the roster. That supposes you have a local mDNSResponder daemon running on your computer. On Linux systems this service will usually be provided by Avahi.
</p><p>
To add a contact to the roster, select Chat -&gt; Add Contact, and fill in the required fields. If the service managing the URI you entered for the contact is able to publish presence status, Ekiga will automatically display it.
</p><p>
If you do not know the VoIP URI of a contact, you might try searching for him/her using the Ekiga.net online directory. To do so, select Chat -&gt; Address Book, and start searching using the 'Search Filter' feature.
</p><div class="tip" title="Astúcia" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Astúcia</h3><p>You can organise your contacts in groups in the roster.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Managing contacts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idp1980432"></a>Managing contacts</h4></div></div></div><div><img src="figures/addressbook_d1.png"></div><p>
<span class="application">Ekiga</span> allows you to look for contacts using various sources like the <a class="ulink" href="https://www.suse.com/products/desktop/features/evolution.html" target="_top">Novell Evolution Email and Calendaring</a> address book, any LDAP directory or the Ekiga.net contact directory. You can use the result of your search to start a chat, call the contact, or simply add him to your roster if you have frequent calls with him. To start looking for contacts, select Chat -&gt; Address Book in the menu.
To your left there will be a list dialog showing the LDAP directories as well as a list of local Address Books. The defaults are the <span class="application">Ekiga</span> white pages, and the personal address book from <a class="ulink" href="https://www.suse.com/products/desktop/features/evolution.html" target="_top">Novell Evolution</a>. Support for more contact sources is possible.
</p><p>
<span class="application">Ekiga</span> is able to browse any LDAP directory and use any attribute as the calling URI. For example, you could have an LDAP directory in your company, with a specific attribute containing the local extensions of all your colleagues. <span class="application">Ekiga</span> is able to use such an LDAP directory. Simply select in Address Book -&gt; Add an LDAP Address Book, and fill in the required details. You can then right-click on the contact and call him using the call attribute as VoIP URI.
</p><div><img src="figures/addressbook_d2.png"></div><p>
The LDAP Address Book supports a range of settings to allow it to work with any LDAPv3 directory. It allows you to choose the attribute to use for displaying a contact's name in the address book as well as a list of attributes for calling info. E.g., if the directory uses the LDAP inetOrgPerson schema you can configure the Address Book to retrieve the homePhone, mobile, and pager attributes make those values available for calling or messaging. You can also customize a Filter Template for the default LDAP search filter, and override the default filter at any time if you need to perform a more specialized search. The browser also supports all security options for LDAP including ldaps:// (LDAP over SSL), StartTLS, and SASL authentication.
</p><p>
To refresh the list of users for a specific address book, simply click the Find button. It will search for all users in that address book. You can contact people by double clicking on their highlighted field. You can also message them by right-clicking or by choosing the appropriate action in the Action menu of the window.
</p><p>
In certain cases you will want to search specifically for a person name, or his or her call URI in the <span class="application">Ekiga</span> white pages. The address book window allows you to apply filters when searching for contacts. When searching an LDAP directory, entering a simple name in the Search Filter field will perform an LDAP Substring search using the configured Filter Template. If you need to perform a more specialized search you can enter a complete LDAP Filter string, and it will be used instead of the configured Filter Template.
</p><div class="tip" title="Astúcia" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Astúcia</h3><p>The <span class="application">Ekiga</span> white pages return a limited number of results corresponding to your search. You can then add them to your personal roster to call them later.</p></div></div><div class="section" title="Editing contacts"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="idp1994880"></a>Editing contacts</h4></div></div></div><div><img src="figures/addressbook_d3.png"></div><p>
Local address books provided by Novell Evolution allow you to add new contacts, or to edit existing contacts. Each different address book allows a different set of features depending on what makes sense for that specific address book. To discover what features are possible, simply select the address book and consult the Action menu, or right-click on the address book name.
</p><p>
To add a contact to one of your local address books, simply select the address book you wish to add the contact to and select Action -&gt; New Contact. The option of adding a New Contact will appear and you may now enter his name and VoIP URI as well as other settings. When finished, select 'OK' and your contact has been added. You can only add contacts to local address books. The contact parameters can be changed at any time by selecting Action -&gt; Edit when the contact is highlighted. He can also be deleted by selecting Action -&gt; Remove.
</p><p>
You can also add a contact from the white pages (or any other local or remote address book) to the roster by selecting Action -&gt; Add to local roster.

<span class="application">Ekiga</span> allows you to send instant messages to remote users provided that you know their URI.
</p><p>
You can send instant messages from the roster, from the call history or from the address book. From the roster or from the call history, simply select Chat -&gt; Contact -&gt; Message in the main window when a contact is highlighted. From the address book window, simply select Action -&gt; Message when the contact is highlighted. A window pops up, enter your text message, and hit the Enter key.

<span class="application">Ekiga</span> allows you to publish your status to other users.
</p><p>
There are three categories of status messages : online, away and busy. Each of them allows you to specify a more complete status information. Simply select Custom message in the status menu at the bottom of the main window. You can then define your extended status message that will be published using all available protocols supporting it.
</p><div class="tip" title="Astúcia" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Astúcia</h3><p>Many servers will not support relaying your extended presence information.

<span class="application">Ekiga</span> supports different policies for unanswered incoming calls. Per default it displays a popup window which allows you to decide whether you want to refuse or accept the request for an incoming call. If you do not answer the call in the required time, or if you are busy, or if you do not want to receive any call, <span class="application">Ekiga</span> can forward the call to another party.
</p><p>
Notice that you need to specify an URI where to forward calls in the preferences to be able to activate that option. Open the preferences window by choosing Edit -&gt; Preferences in the main window and select Call Options on the left. You will now see the appropriate section. It contains three checkboxes for the three cases described above. The URI of the party the calls shall be forwarded to can be configured separately in SIP Settings for SIP and accordingly in H.323 Settings for H.323.
