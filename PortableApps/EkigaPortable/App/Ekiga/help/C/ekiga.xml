<title>Introduction</title>

<section><title>Ekiga</title>
<para><application>&app;</application> is a free Voice over IP, IP Telephony and Video-Conferencing application for Linux and other Unices (e.g BSD, OpenSolaris or MacOSX). It was written by Damien Sandras and is licensed under the GNU/GPL.
</para>

<para>
Ekiga is able to use modern Voice over IP protocols like SIP and H.323. It supports all major features defined by those protocols like <emphasis>call hold</emphasis>, <emphasis>call transfer</emphasis>, <emphasis>call forwarding</emphasis>, ... It also supports <emphasis>instant messaging</emphasis>, and <emphasis>presence</emphasis>. It also has advanced support for <emphasis>NAT traversal</emphasis>.
Ekiga supports the best <emphasis>free</emphasis> audio and video codecs, and has wideband support for a superior audio quality, together with echo cancellation.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>SIP and H.323</title>
<para>
The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a protocol developed by the IETF MMUSIC Working Group and proposed standard for initiating, modifying, and terminating an interactive user session that involves multimedia elements such as video, voice, instant messaging, online games, and virtual reality. In November 2000, SIP was accepted as a 3GPP signaling protocol and permanent element of the IMS architecture. It is one of the leading signalling protocols for Voice over IP.
</para>

<para>
H.323 was originally created to provide a mechanism for transporting multimedia applications over LANs but it has rapidly evolved to address the growing needs of VoIP networks. One strength of H.323 was the relatively early availability of a set of standards, not only defining the basic call model, but in addition the supplementary services, needed to address business communication expectations. H.323 was the first VoIP standard to adopt the IETF standard RTP to transport audio and video over IP networks. H.323 is based on the ISDN Q.931 protocol and is suited for interworking scenarios between IP and ISDN, respectively between IP and QSIG. A call model, similar to the ISDN call model, eases the introduction of IP Telephony into existing networks of ISDN based PBX systems.

<section><title>From computer to computer (PC-To-PC)</title>
<para>If you want to call other users and to be callable, you need a SIP address. You can get a SIP address from <ulink url="http://www.ekiga.net" type="http">http://www.ekiga.net</ulink> as described above.</para>

<para>The SIP address can be used by other users to call you. Similarly, you can use the SIP address of your friends and family to call them. You can for example use <emphasis>sip:dsandras@ekiga.net</emphasis> to call the author of Ekiga.</para>

<para>You can use the online address book of <application>&app;</application> to find the SIP addresses of other <application>&app;</application> users. It is of course possible to call users who are using another provider than ekiga.net. You can actually call any user using SIP software or hardware, and registered to any public SIP provider</para>

<para>If you know the URI address of the party that you wish to call, you may choose the Chat -> Call a number action, enter that URI into the sip: input box at the bottom of the window and press the Connect button; eg: sip:foo@ekiga.net and clicking on the Connect button would call the user at that address.</para>

<para>It is also possible to call contacts using the address book, the call history or the roster.

<title>Managing Contacts</title>

<section><title>Adding contacts to the roster</title>
<graphic fileref="figures/roster.png"></graphic>

<para>
<application>&app;</application> allows you to add the contacts you
dial the most to the roster, so that you can call or start a chat conversation with your friends without having to remember their URI. If supported by the service you are connecting to, <application>&app;</application> will display <emphasis>extended presence information</emphasis> about your friends.
Ekiga.net supports publishing presence information for its users. Software PBX systems like <ulink url="http://www.asterisk.org" type="http">Asterisk</ulink> can report if a user is on the phone or not, and <application>&app;</application> will display that information in its roster.
</para>

<para>
You can thus use <application>&app;</application> to monitor lines on your PBX.
</para>

<para>
<application>&app;</application> is also able to detect other <application>&app;</application> users on the LAN using the Bonjour technology popularized by Apple (tm) and to display them in the roster. That supposes you have a local mDNSResponder daemon running on your computer. On Linux systems this service will usually be provided by Avahi.
</para>

<para>
To add a contact to the roster, select Chat -> Add Contact, and fill in the required fields. If the service managing the URI you entered for the contact is able to publish presence status, Ekiga will automatically display it.
</para>

<para>
If you do not know the VoIP URI of a contact, you might try searching for him/her using the Ekiga.net online directory. To do so, select Chat -> Address Book, and start searching using the 'Search Filter' feature.
</para>

<tip><title>Tip</title><para>You can organise your contacts in groups in the roster.</para></tip>
</section>

<section><title>Managing contacts</title>
<graphic fileref="figures/addressbook_d1.png"></graphic>

<para>
<application>&app;</application> allows you to look for contacts using various sources like the <ulink url="https://www.suse.com/products/desktop/features/evolution.html" type="http">Novell Evolution Email and Calendaring</ulink> address book, any LDAP directory or the Ekiga.net contact directory. You can use the result of your search to start a chat, call the contact, or simply add him to your roster if you have frequent calls with him. To start looking for contacts, select Chat -> Address Book in the menu.
To your left there will be a list dialog showing the LDAP directories as well as a list of local Address Books. The defaults are the <application>&app;</application> white pages, and the personal address book from <ulink url="https://www.suse.com/products/desktop/features/evolution.html" type="http">Novell Evolution</ulink>. Support for more contact sources is possible.
</para>

<para>
<application>&app;</application> is able to browse any LDAP directory and use any attribute as the calling URI. For example, you could have an LDAP directory in your company, with a specific attribute containing the local extensions of all your colleagues. <application>&app;</application> is able to use such an LDAP directory. Simply select in Address Book -> Add an LDAP Address Book, and fill in the required details. You can then right-click on the contact and call him using the call attribute as VoIP URI.
</para>

<graphic fileref="figures/addressbook_d2.png"></graphic>

<para>
The LDAP Address Book supports a range of settings to allow it to work with any LDAPv3 directory. It allows you to choose the attribute to use for displaying a contact's name in the address book as well as a list of attributes for calling info. E.g., if the directory uses the LDAP inetOrgPerson schema you can configure the Address Book to retrieve the homePhone, mobile, and pager attributes make those values available for calling or messaging. You can also customize a Filter Template for the default LDAP search filter, and override the default filter at any time if you need to perform a more specialized search. The browser also supports all security options for LDAP including ldaps:// (LDAP over SSL), StartTLS, and SASL authentication.
</para>

<para>
To refresh the list of users for a specific address book, simply click the Find button. It will search for all users in that address book. You can contact people by double clicking on their highlighted field. You can also message them by right-clicking or by choosing the appropriate action in the Action menu of the window.
</para>

<para>
In certain cases you will want to search specifically for a person name, or his or her call URI in the <application>&app;</application> white pages. The address book window allows you to apply filters when searching for contacts. When searching an LDAP directory, entering a simple name in the Search Filter field will perform an LDAP Substring search using the configured Filter Template. If you need to perform a more specialized search you can enter a complete LDAP Filter string, and it will be used instead of the configured Filter Template.
</para>

<tip><title>Tip</title><para>The <application>&app;</application> white pages return a limited number of results corresponding to your search. You can then add them to your personal roster to call them later.</para></tip>
</section>

<section><title>Editing contacts</title>
<graphic fileref="figures/addressbook_d3.png"></graphic>

<para>
Local address books provided by Novell Evolution allow you to add new contacts, or to edit existing contacts. Each different address book allows a different set of features depending on what makes sense for that specific address book. To discover what features are possible, simply select the address book and consult the Action menu, or right-click on the address book name.
</para>

<para>
To add a contact to one of your local address books, simply select the address book you wish to add the contact to and select Action -> New Contact.

<section id="ekiga-video-bandwidth">
<title>Controlling the Video Bandwidth</title>

<para><application>&app;</application> uses a best-effort algorithm to maintain a low bandwidth when transmitting video. <!-- You can adjust the video quality settings depending on whether you prefer to have a good frame rate, or a good picture quality.--> It will permit <application>&app;</application> to dynamically adjust the video bandwidth and the number of transmitted images per second during a call while trying to respect the requested video bandwidth.</para>

<para>Notice that the algorithm is a best-effort algorithm, which means that if your video bandwidth settings are too low, it can be impossible to respect them. However, if the video bandwidth permits to transmit with a better quality, or faster than the requested values, then <application>&app;</application> will dynamically increase them so that the quality and the framerate are always the best possible.</para>

<!-- <para>Choosing a higher framerate and a lower quality will have the same result in terms of video bandwidth as choosing a higher quality with a lower framerate. The choice depends on if you prefer using your bandwidth to transmit more lower quality images or fewer high quality images.</para>-->

<graphic fileref="figures/audio_codecs.png"></graphic>

<para>
The <application>&app;</application> audio codecs table in the preferences permits you to change the codec order as well as disabling the codecs you don't want to use. Each codec has strong and weak points. For example, G.711 will give the best voice quality but will use the most bandwidth while SPEEX will give an average voice quality but requiring a very low bandwidth usage. Notice that there are two versions of SPEEX; one of them is SPEEX WideBand, which has a 16 kHz clock rate.</para>
</section>

<section><title>Video Codecs</title>

<graphic fileref="figures/video_codecs.png"></graphic>

<para>
The <application>&app;</application> video codecs table in the preferences permits you to change the codec order as well as disabling the codecs you don't want to use. <application>&app;</application> supports codecs like H.261, H.263+, H.264, MPEG-4 or Theora.</para>
</section>


<section><title>Reordering the codecs</title>
<para>
When you reorder the codecs, you are reordering the local capabilities table, ie the codecs you will use for sending. The codec used is the first active codec on receiver which is active on sender.<!--You will always transmit audio and video using the first codec in the corresponding table that is in common with the remote user. The remote user will transmit audio and video using the first codec in his table that is common with you.--></para>
</section>

<section><title>Forcing the use of a specific codec</title>
<para>
You can force the use of a specific codec by disabling all other codecs, but it will result in failed calls if the remote user doesn't support that specific codec. The best approach is to put your preferred codecs at the top of the list so that you always transmit with them if the remote user allows it and to disable the codecs that you don't want to use for transmission and reception.</para>
</section>

<section><title>Adjusting the jitter buffer</title>
<para>
You can adjust the delay to wait before playing the sound buffers that you have received using the jitter buffer adjustment. If there is too much packet loss, the delay required to have received all packets could be so important that it will exceed the jitter buffer. In such a case, the sound you are receiving will be of bad quality. A solution to that problem would be to increase the maximum limit of the jitter buffer to a few seconds, resulting in a big delay but in an improved voice quality. Notice that the jitter buffer will readapt itself to the lowest delay allowing for optimum transmission, and that a bad voice quality in reception is not due to a too low jitter buffer value, but to bad internet connection quality.

<title>Changing Ports</title>

<section><title>The listen ports</title>
<para>
The main port used to listen for incoming connections in <application>&app;</application> for SIP is port 5060 (UDP), while 1720 (TCP) is used by H.323. To change those ports you need to load "gconf-editor". Open gconf-editor, select apps from the left hand side menu and then select <application>&app;</application>, Protocols. Then select "sip" or "h323", it should give you a list in the corresponding window to your right. Select listen_port and change it to your desired value. You can also change the UDP/RTP port ranges.
</para>
</section>

<section><title>Explanation of the port ranges</title>

<para>1. The "listen_port" value is the port <application>&app;</application> will use to listen for incoming connections. It is different for SIP and H.323.</para>

<para>2. The "udp_port_range" value is the range of UDP ports that <application>&app;</application> will use for SIP signalling or when registering to H.323 gatekeepers. It is also used for RTP (audio and video communication channels).</para>

<para>3. The "tcp_port_range" value is the range of TCP ports beside the listen_port that <application>&app;</application> will use for the H.245 channel with the H.323 protocol. That port range is not used by SIP. It is also not used when H.245 Tunneling is enabled, which is generally the case, except when calling old H.323 implementations like Netmeeting.</para>

</section>

<section><title>Advanced Settings</title>
<para><application>&app;</application> permits a fine control of the H.323 settings in the Advanced H.323 Settings section of the preferences. You can enable H.245 Tunneling, Early H.245 and Fast Start.</para>

<para><emphasis>H.245 Tunneling</emphasis></para>

<para>H.245 Tunneling is the encapsulation of H.245 messages within H.225/Q.931 messages (H.245 Tunneling). If you have a firewall and enable H.245 Tunneling, there is one less TCP port that you need to allow for incoming connections.</para>

<para><emphasis>Early H.245</emphasis></para>

<para>This enables H.245 early in the setup and permits achieving faster call initiation.</para>

<para><emphasis>Fast Start</emphasis></para>

<para>Fast Connect is a new method of call setup that bypasses some usual steps in order to make it faster. In addition to the speed improvement, Fast Connect allows the media channels to be operational before the CONNECT message is sent, which is a requirement for certain billing procedures. It was introduced in H.323 version 2.</para>
