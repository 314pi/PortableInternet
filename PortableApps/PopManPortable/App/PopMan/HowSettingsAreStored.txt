By default, all PopMan settings (e.g. email account information) are stored
in the Windows registry: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\PopMan
You can use the Windows tool regedit.exe to modify the settings.
All user specific files (log files, black list, white list, rules, temp files)
are stored in the Application Data folder. The exact name depends on 
the system language and your user name, e.g.:
  
  English: C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\PopMan
  German:  C:\Dokumente und Einstellungen\BENUTZERNAME\Anwendungsdaten\PopMan

  
If you want to store the settings into an ini File instead of the registry,
you only need to create an empty file called PopMan.ini in the PopMan folder.
On the next PopMan startup, all settings are imported from the registry
and will be saved to this ini file when PopMan quits. The user specific files
are stored in the PopMan subfolder "Data".
