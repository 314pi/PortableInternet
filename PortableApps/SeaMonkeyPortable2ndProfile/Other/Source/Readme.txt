ABOUT SEAMONKEY PORTABLE
========================
The SeaMonkey Portable Launcher allows you to run SeaMonkey from a removable drive
whose letter changes as you move it to another computer.  The browser and the
profile can be entirely self-contained on the drive and then used on any Windows
computer.  Specific configuration changes are made to the chrome.rdf so that
your extensions will still work as the drive letter changes.
