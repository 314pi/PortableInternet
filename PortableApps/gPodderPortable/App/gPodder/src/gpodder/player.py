# gpodder.player - Podcatcher implementation of the Media Player D-Bus API
# Thomas Perl <thp@gpodder.org>; 2010-04-25
#

#
# This API specification aims at providing a documented, easy-to-use API for
# getting and setting the media player position via D-Bus. This should allow
# media players (such as Panucci) and podcast aggregators (such as gPodder) to
# work together and synchronize the playback position of media files.
#
# == Interface: org.gpodder.player ==
#
# - PlaybackStarted(uint32 position, string file_uri)
#
#   Emitted when the media player starts playback of a given file at file_uri
#   at the position position.
#
#
# - PlaybackStopped(uint32 start_position, uint32 end_position,
#                   uint32 total_time, string file_uri)
#
#   Emitted when the user stops/pauses playback, when the playback ends or the
#   player is closed. The file URI is in file_uri, the start time of the
#   segment that has just been played is in start_position, the stop time in
#   end_position and the (detected) total time of the file is in total_time.
#
#   Seeking in the file should also emit a PlaybackStopped signal (at the
#   position where the seek is initialized) and a PlaybackStarted signal (at
#   the position to which the seek jumps).
