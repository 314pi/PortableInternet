<b>KVS</b> is the <b>KV</b>irc <b>S</b>cripting language.
It was inspired by C++,sh,perl,php and mIrc scripting language implementations.
It is a compromise between flexibility and speed, a 'workaround' for many intrinsic
problems of an IRC-oriented scripting language.
</p>
<p>
KVS is semi-interpreted: the execution is done in two main stages.
The first stage is the compilation where a syntactic tree is built.
The second stage is the real execution and is performed by visiting the tree
in the proper order. The syntactic trees are cached in memory so
the next executions can jump directly into the second stage.
This two-stage approach has been introduced in version 3.0.0, the previous
versions of the language used a single-stage on-the-fly interpreter.
</p>
<p>
KVS allows you to:<br>
<ul>
<li>Implement automated reactions to the <a href="doc_events.html">events</a> generated by an <a href="doc_rfc2812.html">IRC</a> network</li>
<li>Add new complex commands</li>
<li>Add interface elements like popups, toolbars, buttons...</li>
<li>Add advanced interface elements like complete dialogs or even widgets integrated in KVIrc</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
KVS contains all the common constructs of structured programming.
You will find almost all the C control commands, sh/perl-like <a href="doc_kvs_datatypes.html">variables</a>, arrays and and <a href="doc_kvs_aliasesandfunctions.html">functions</a>.
There are also some object-oriented characteristics: you will find C++ like
<a href="doc_objects.html">objects</a> with constructors, destructors and <a href="class_object.html">class</a> inheritance.
There are also more exotic concepts like the signal-slots interobject-communication.
Obviously you will also find most of the RFC1459 <a href="doc_rfc2812.html">IRC</a> commands and
other tools to "play" with an <a href="doc_rfc2812.html">IRC</a> connection.
</p>
<p>
I'll try to explain the language by using examples
instead of strict syntactic rules. (Actually I have even
tried to write the rules...take a look <a href="doc_syntactic_rules.html">here</a><br><br>
And please...forgive me for my "fantastic" english :)
