The "file offers" are a simple way to share your files with other <a href="doc_rfc2812.html">IRC</a> users.<br>
Basically, you setup an offer by selecting a local file, choosing a "visible name" for it.
Remote users will be able to request you the file and download it automatically by
issuing a simple DCC GET request.<br>
</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#A7D3DB"><div style="font-size:16pt;font-weight:800;">Details</div></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#EAEAEA">
Each offer refers to an existing file on one of your locally mounted file systems.
The offer is given a visible name that the remote users will effectively request.
To share the file /usr/arch/mp3/SonataArctica_SingInSilence_Live.mp3 you will add a file offer
with /usr/arch/mp3/SonataArctica_SingInSilence_Live.mp3 as real file path, something like
"SonataArctica_SingInSilence.mp3". A remote user will then request you a DCC GET SonataArctica_SingInSilence.mp3
and <a href="doc_kvircintro.html">KVIrc</a> will automatically send the file.<br>
Each file offer has an "user mask" that the requesting remote users must match to
obtain the file: *!*@* matches any user, Pragma!*@* matches any user with <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a> pragma,
*!*@*.omnikron.net matches any user coming from the omnikron.net domain.<br>
Each offer can have an expire time: the offer will be automatically removed after
a defined number of seconds. An expire time of '0' seconds means that the offer should never expire.<br>
If you have two file offers with the same name and different file, the remote user can
use an additional "size" parameter in the DCC GET request.<br>
</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#A7D3DB"><div style="font-size:16pt;font-weight:800;">Security issues</div></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#EAEAEA">
This is a nice but unsecure method of sharing files.<br>
The user mask is a good protection but you have to use it properly!.<br>
Setting the user mask to Nick!*@* can be easily exploited (just by making an user disconnect
in one of the well known ways and then by using his <a href="doc_irc_masks.html">nickname</a>).<br>
On the other side, the remote end must know exactly the visible name of the offer to request
and noone but you will tell him that name.<br>
In sum:<br>
Don't share any really important files: this *might* be like putting it on your webpage :D<br>
Please don't send complains if someone stoles your /etc/passwd : it is because you have permitted that.<br>
