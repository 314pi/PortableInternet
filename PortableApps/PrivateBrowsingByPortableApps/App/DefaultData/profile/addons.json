It then leaves placeholders on the webpage that allow you to click to download and then view the Flash content.\n\nFlashblock currently blocks the following content types:\n* Macromedia Flash\n* Macromedia Shockwave\n* Macromedia Authorware\n\nOur public support forums can be accessed via:\nour mailing list: http://www.mozdev.org/mailman/listinfo/flashblock\nor newsgroup: news://news.mozdev.org/public.mozdev.flashblock\n\nPlease report support issues at: http://www.mozdev.org/mailman/listinfo/flashblock This mailing list is public, other people can see your messages including your email address.\n\nTo send private email please use our contact webpage at: http://flashblock.mozdev.org/contact.html\n\nNote: Flashblock does not work with Javascript disabled or with NoScript installed.\n\nsoundcloud.com: I've added a FAQ entry on how to get Soundcloud working with Flashblock. http://flashblock.mozdev.org/faq.html#fbSoundCloud\n\nWhitelists: Make sure that you leave out the protocol prefix e.g. \"https://\" so to whitelist youtube, you should just use \"youtube.com\".\n\nA User mentioned that whitelisting youtube videos embedded on other sites stopped working because the URL has changed, You should now whitelist \"s.ytimg.com/yt\" instead.\n\nFoxTab: To allow FoxTab to work without interruption please add \"chrome\" to the Flashblock whitelist (without the '\" quotes).\n\nGoogle Street View: Flashblock is reported to prevent Google Street View from running when trying to start it from Google Maps. Please add maps.google.com to the Flashblock whitelist (For regional versions of Google such as maps.google.ch, maps.google.fr, and maps.google.de use \"maps.google\" as the whitelist string). The easiest way to do this is to put the Flashblock toolbar button on a toolbar and then clicking on the drop marker on the right edge of the button.
